Shut That Down is a collection of misogynist, racist, xenophobic, homophobic, and transphobic quotes by politicians -- and the corporations that fund them.

#### Is your politician a ...
* misogynist?
* racist?
* xenophobe?
* homophobe?
* transphobe?

#### We have ways to shut that whole thing down.

#### We'll show you the companies funding hate speech (and how to contact them!)

#### You can shut that whole thing down by asking companies:
* Did you know they **said** that?
* Are you comfortable with that?
* Do you want your brand associated with that?
* Or are you going to get your money back?
